# IMU_GPS_Trajectory_Generator
 Using this toolbox we produce IMU and GPS trajectories via carrier kinematics , Based on equations in "Principles of GNSS, Inertial, and Multisensor Integrated Navigation Systems, 2nd. Edition" by professor Groves
It should be noted that there's an error in the implementation of equation 5.86 in Kinematics_NED.m and possibly also the inertial navigation equations.
