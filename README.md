# Developing Navigation Algorithms: A Toolbox for Reliable IMU and GNSS Trajectories

To create robust navigation algorithms, having a platform to generate dependable IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) trajectories is imperative. This toolbox facilitates the provision of arbitrary data for your algorithm, drawing from the equations outlined in "Principles of GNSS, Inertial, and Multisensor Integrated Navigation Systems, 2nd Edition" authored by Professor Groves.

Usage Instructions:

To employ this toolbox, follow the instructions below:

1-[Step 1 instruction]
2-[Step 2 instruction]
3-[Step 3 instruction]

Using this toolbox we produce IMU and GPS trajectories via carrier kinematics , 
It should be noted that there's an error in the implementation of equation 5.86 in Kinematics_NED.m and possibly also the inertial navigation equations.
